Product Requirements Document (PRD)

Vision & Summary

RealCraft (working title) is a single-player sandbox game inspired by Minecraft, emphasizing extreme realism in graphics, physics, and world generation. The goal is to deliver the creative freedom and infinite procedural world of Minecraft but with lifelike visuals and mechanics. RealCraft features real-time ray traced graphics for natural lighting, a physics system where structures behave realistically (no floating blocks), and an infinite, living world shaped by advanced procedural generation (including algorithms like hydraulic erosion for realistic terrain). Players can enjoy both Creative mode (unlimited resources to build freely) and Survival mode (resource gathering, crafting, and realistic survival challenges) in a world that feels authentic yet remains fun and playable.

Goals & Objectives
	•	Hyper-Realistic Graphics: Achieve cutting-edge visual fidelity using ray tracing/path tracing for lighting, shadows, reflections, and materials. The graphics should dramatically surpass vanilla Minecraft’s appearance while maintaining good performance on modern hardware.
	•	Realistic Physics: Implement a physics system where game objects obey real-world principles (gravity, collision, material weight). Structures require support; unsupported constructions will collapse. Fluids flow naturally and objects break into debris when destroyed, providing immersion and new gameplay opportunities.
	•	Infinite Procedural World: Generate a practically infinite world with diverse biomes, realistic terrain formation, and natural features. Use advanced procedural generation techniques (noise functions, fractal algorithms, and simulated erosion processes) to create landscapes that look hand-crafted by nature ￼. The world should be at least as vast as Minecraft’s (~60 million blocks across, ~60,000 km, about 5× the diameter of Earth ￼), ensuring endless exploration.
	•	Creative & Survival Modes: Provide two primary game modes. Creative mode allows players to unleash creativity with unlimited resources and tools (ideal for building and designing without constraints). Survival mode offers a challenging experience with resource gathering, crafting, realistic environmental dangers, and health/hunger management. Both modes exist in the same realistic world, with Creative focusing on building and Survival on immersive gameplay.
	•	Platform & Performance: Ensure the game runs smoothly on macOS as a first-class platform (utilizing Apple’s Metal API and hardware features), and ideally support Windows and Linux for broader reach. The custom engine must efficiently use all available compute resources (multi-core CPUs, GPU compute, hardware ray tracing cores, etc.) to deliver high fidelity at playable frame rates (targeting 60 FPS). Performance optimization is a key objective so that realism does not come at the expense of playability.
	•	Scope Constraints: This project focuses on the core single-player experience. Multiplayer, modding support, or dedicated server infrastructure are out of scope for the initial version. We also will not be constrained by specific budget or timeline considerations in this document – the emphasis is on an ideal feature set and design, acknowledging that this is an ambitious project.

Key Features & Requirements

1. Realistic Ray-Traced Graphics
The game’s visual presentation should be state-of-the-art for a voxel sandbox. Lighting and rendering will use real-time ray tracing or path tracing techniques to simulate light with physical accuracy. This means implementing features such as:
	•	Global Illumination and Shadows: Light will bounce off surfaces, illuminating other areas indirectly for true global illumination. Every object can cast soft, realistic shadows that diffuse with distance ￼. For example, sunlight entering a cave will scatter and gradually fade, instead of the uniform lighting in Minecraft’s engine.
	•	Reflections and Refractions: With path tracing, reflective materials (water, metal, etc.) will show accurate reflections of the world, and transparent materials like glass or ice will refract light and even cast caustics ￼. A glass window in a player-built house will create realistic highlights and distortions of the view behind it, contributing to immersion.
	•	Atmospheric Effects: The engine will render effects like volumetric fog, god rays, and colored lighting through media. For instance, rays of sunlight will stream through forest canopies and windows, realistically illuminating dust or fog in the air ￼. Nighttime will feature moonlight and torchlight that behave naturally, with smooth falloff and dynamic shadows.
	•	Physically Based Materials: We will use a PBR (physically-based rendering) material system with high-resolution textures. Different block types will have properties like roughness, metallic or dielectric behavior, and emissive qualities. This allows, for example, polished stone to appear glossy under light, or lava to emit a warm glow that lights up its surroundings.

Comparison of a voxel cave scene without ray tracing (top) and with path-traced lighting (bottom). The ray-traced version showcases realistic global illumination – notice the soft shadows, indirect light bounce, and volumetric god rays that bring the scene to life.

Enabling path-traced rendering dramatically improves realism: light now bounces off surfaces, illuminating dark areas indirectly, and reflective materials like water show accurate reflections. These images illustrate the target visual difference that RealCraft’s graphics will achieve.

Performance Consideration: Ray tracing is computationally intensive (Minecraft’s official RTX path tracing, for example, is gorgeous but very demanding ￼). To meet our performance goal, the engine will utilize hardware-accelerated ray tracing (e.g. NVIDIA RTX, AMD Ray Accelerators, Apple’s GPU RT support) and advanced algorithms like denoising and adaptive sampling. We will also explore hybrid techniques – for example, using a Sparse Voxel Octree (SVO) for static global illumination data and updating only local dynamic changes in real-time, an approach which can achieve Minecraft RTX-like results with far less cost ￼. The rendering engine may dynamically reduce ray tracing detail at long distances (where the player can’t notice fine differences) and leverage upscaling technologies (such as DLSS or FSR where available) to maintain high frame rates. Ensuring the game is playable on Mac means optimizing for Apple’s Metal API and possibly using Metal’s raytracing support on Apple Silicon GPUs, while on PC using Vulkan or DirectX Raytracing for cross-platform compatibility. Cross-platform parity is a goal, but macOS optimization is a priority.

2. Realistic Physics & Gameplay Mechanics
RealCraft will incorporate a physics engine that makes the world behave believably:
	•	Gravity & Structural Integrity: Unlike Minecraft, blocks will not float unsupported. Every block or structure will be subject to gravity and material strength. If a player mines out the support under a heavy stone ceiling, it will crack and collapse under its own weight. We will assign each material a weight and an integrity limit (similar to games like 7 Days to Die’s approach to block stability). When support is removed, the engine will calculate stress on connected blocks – if it exceeds a threshold, those blocks will break off and fall. This creates emergent gameplay (e.g. players can intentionally fell trees or cause cave-ins). “If a structure’s ability to stand or support other things is compromised, voxels can detect that” leading to a collapse and debris ￼.
	•	Destruction & Debris: When blocks or structures collapse, they don’t vanish – they fragment into physical debris chunks. These chunks are themselves dynamic objects that collide with the world. The physics engine can compute properties like mass and center of gravity of a chunk based on its voxel composition (summing the weight of each voxel of a material) ￼. For example, a stone tower that collapses might break into large chunks; heavy stone pieces will fall faster and hit the ground with convincing force, potentially damaging other blocks on impact. This voxel-based approach to physics ensures even complex-shaped assemblies behave realistically.
	•	Fluid Dynamics: Water and other fluids will have more natural behavior than simple source blocks. Fluids should flow and settle according to physics – water will run downhill, form rivers and lakes, and exert buoyant force. Full CFD simulation is costly, so we will use a simplified model (perhaps a grid-based shallow water simulation for large bodies, and particle fluids for local interactions). Water will erode soil over time and carry sediment in world generation (see Procedural World section), and possibly in gameplay (e.g. strong currents could wash away loose dirt). In survival mode, flowing water can pose hazards (rapids, floods) but also opportunities (hydrodynamic machines).
	•	Player & Entity Physics: The player character and any creatures/NPCs obey physics as well. The player has weight and momentum – no more instantly stopping on a dime or changing direction mid-air. Jumping, falling, or colliding with objects will feel physical (with appropriate animation and perhaps ragdoll effects for falls). Vehicles or moving platforms (if any) will integrate with physics. We will ensure the controls remain tight and fun – this is not a pure simulator – by tweaking friction, damping, and other parameters, but the underlying system should be consistent and realistic.
	•	Interactions & Tools: Gameplay elements like explosions or projectiles will use physics. TNT (if included) will create a pressure blast that breaks blocks and throws fragments outward. Arrows or thrown objects will follow parabolic trajectories affected by gravity. Machines or contraptions built by players (like pistons or rotating parts if implemented) will use the physics engine for motion. Realistic physics will enable creative engineering gameplay (e.g. building bridges that must support weight, or constructing catapults).

Gameplay Balancing: In Survival mode, realistic physics means players must consider structural support when building a base and can’t exploit floating blocks. However, to keep the game enjoyable, we may allow certain simplifications (for example, small wooden structures might be forgiving or an optional “physics toggle” in Creative mode so players can experiment freely). Realistic does not mean frustrating: the game design will be tuned so that physics-based collapses or accidents are a manageable challenge, not constant nuisance. In Creative mode, physics could be optionally disabled or made non-lethal, so players can focus on building. The overarching goal is an immersive, believable sandbox that still feels like a game.

3. Infinite Procedural World Generation
RealCraft features an infinite, procedurally generated world that is rich, varied, and impressively realistic. World generation will use a combination of classic noise-based techniques and cutting-edge simulation to shape the terrain:
	•	Chunk System & Scale: The world is divided into chunks (e.g. 64×64 meter sections) that generate on the fly as the player explores, similar to Minecraft. This allows the world to effectively extend without bound while managing memory. We will implement an origin shifting or multi-coordinate system to avoid floating-point precision issues as the player travels millions of meters from the origin (Minecraft’s world is ~60 million meters from center to edge ￼, and we target a comparable scale). The generation algorithm will be deterministic based on a world seed, so the same areas can be regenerated or shared if needed.
	•	Terrain Formation: We will utilize layered perlin/simplex noise functions and fractal algorithms to create realistic base landforms – mountains, valleys, plains, caves. This includes applying octave noise for terrain roughness and ridges for sharp mountain peaks. However, raw noise often looks unnatural. To achieve natural realism, we incorporate erosion simulation into the generation pipeline. Hydraulic erosion algorithms will simulate rainfall and water flow carving the terrain, creating authentic river networks, eroded hillsides, and delta plains ￼. This technique adds realistic valleys and drainage patterns that purely procedural heightmaps lack. Traditionally, erosion simulation is computationally heavy (it requires iterating over every terrain cell many times), but we can leverage modern optimizations: for instance, a GPU implementation can process a 1024×1024 heightmap in ~2 milliseconds per iteration ￼ ￼. Recent research even demonstrates extremely fast erosion methods – on an RTX 3060, a 1024×1024 terrain can be eroded in ~100ms (meaning ~10 square kilometers per second) ￼. We will use a multi-threaded and GPU-accelerated approach to run erosion on chunks as they generate, possibly simulating multiple erosion “raindrop” passes in parallel. The result is terrain that shows realistic river channels, alluvial plains, and smooth weathered slopes, giving the world a coherent, Earth-like appearance.
	•	Biomes & Ecology: The world will be divided into biomes (desert, forest, tundra, etc.) with smooth transitions governed by latitude/altitude and noise. We aim for realistic biome placement – for example, tall snowy mountains feeding rivers that run into fertile valleys and out to oceans. A climate model might be used to distribute rainfall and temperature, influencing where deserts vs. forests form. Vegetation will be procedurally generated within biomes: forests with tree species appropriate to climate (using possibly L-systems or procedural tree generators for varied shapes), grass and foliage cover, etc. Fauna (animals) can also spawn according to biome, though advanced AI for animals is less a focus than the world itself. The world generation should also account for resources distribution (ores, minerals) in a realistic way – e.g., certain minerals only in certain rock layers or biomes – to enrich survival gameplay.
	•	Caves and Subsurface Features: An infinite world isn’t just a surface – RealCraft will generate extensive cave systems, underground rivers, and maybe even realistic ore veins and fossil layers. We will combine noise-based 3D density fields (for generating caves via methods like Perlin worms or cellular automata) with the erosion logic (e.g., simulating subsurface water flow to carve out caverns or karst caves). Caves will feel more natural in shape than Minecraft’s mostly blocky tunnels. Stalactites, stalagmites, and other decor could be added via procedural models. The world’s vertical depth will be significant (e.g., allow very tall mountains and deep caves), enabled by our custom engine not being limited to Minecraft’s fixed height.
	•	Continuous Generation & Streaming: As the player moves, new chunks are generated at the fringes of the visible area and distant ones are unloaded to save memory. We’ll implement a caching system and possibly level of detail (LOD) for terrain – distant terrain might be generated at lower resolution or as heightmap-only until approached, to reduce computational load. Since generation involves heavy steps (like erosion), we will do it asynchronously on background threads or GPU tasks so it doesn’t stall gameplay. The engine can generate chunks slightly ahead of the player’s view distance, and we may employ double-buffering of chunk updates to avoid visible pop-in. If needed, less critical steps (like very fine erosion detail) can be done in a deferred way – e.g., generate a quick approximate terrain, let the player start seeing it, then apply additional erosion passes as time permits to refine the detail.
	•	Hydrology and Water Systems: The placement of rivers and lakes will emerge naturally from the heightmap erosion simulation (water flows downhill and is tracked as part of generation). Rivers will connect down to oceans (sea level areas) where possible. The world will have a water table and possibly simulate aquifers – digging might hit water. We’ll ensure that water sources are infinite (for large bodies) but use a plausible model for flow. Waterfalls, rapids, and ponds should appear in appropriate places. The procedural generation may also include other natural phenomena: for instance, maybe volcanoes in certain biomes (with lava flows), glaciers in polar zones (with glacial erosion shaping valleys), and so on, time permitting.

Overall, the procedural generation aim is a world that looks like it could be real, with geology and geography that make sense, yet still has the fantastical freedom of a voxel sandbox. This will set the stage for unique emergent gameplay in survival mode (e.g. following a river to find a lush valley to settle, or mining into a mountain that has a realistic ore distribution) and endless beautiful vistas for creative mode builders.

4. Game Modes & Gameplay Elements
RealCraft will have two primary modes, Creative and Survival, each with specific requirements:
	•	Creative Mode: This mode is all about free building and exploration with no survival constraints. Players have unlimited resources and can spawn any block or item from an in-game palette/inventory. They can also fly or move freely to build large structures easily. In Creative, the focus is on the sandbox as a canvas – players should be able to construct complex, realistic structures without worrying about gravity killing them or running out of materials. However, because we emphasize realism, even in Creative mode the world’s physics and lighting remain active by default – structures still need support (or they’ll collapse) and the beautiful ray-traced lighting still applies. We may provide options (in settings) to relax physics in Creative if players want to experiment with floating designs or test things without collapse. Creative mode will also likely include tools like instant block destruction, the ability to pause or slow time (for setting up lighting for screenshots, etc.), and possibly a way to spawn creatures or effects for scene creation. The PRD does not require modding tools or scripting in Creative, keeping scope on core features.
	•	Survival Mode: In survival, the player starts with nothing and must gather resources from the environment to survive, build shelter, and progress. Core survival mechanics include health and injury (taking damage from falls, physics impacts, or creatures), hunger and thirst (needing to eat, and possibly drink water, to survive), and day-night cycles with associated dangers (e.g. perhaps predators or other hostile creatures come out at night). Crafting will be implemented similar to Minecraft: players combine resources (wood, stone, ores, etc.) to craft tools, weapons, and building materials. The realism angle suggests more in-depth mechanics (for example, requiring a fire to cook food, smelting ore in a furnace to get metal, etc.), but we will balance complexity to keep it fun. Building in Survival requires gathering enough materials and dealing with physics – e.g., you’ll need scaffolding or supports to build a large house; if you try to build a broad roof with insufficient support, it might collapse. This adds a new layer of challenge and realism to the familiar Minecraft gameplay. Environment and AI: The world will have animals (for food, crafting materials like leather/wool, and ecosystem realism). Some animals might be hostile (bears in the forest, etc.), adding combat or stealth elements. Weather and climate can affect survival – e.g., getting cold in a snowy biome without proper clothing or shelter could harm the player, rain might douse fires, etc. These features create a deeper survival experience but can be tuned via difficulty settings.

Despite the added realism, Survival mode should remain accessible. Players who understand Minecraft should find the basic loop familiar: punch trees to get wood, craft basic tools, mine stone and ores, build a shelter, etc., now enriched with realistic visuals and physics. The PRD does not detail every crafting recipe or survival feature, but it demands that the overall system is coherent and engaging in a realistic world context. The game will be single-player only for now, so all survival systems only need to consider one player (no networking issues or balancing for multiple players).

5. Platform Requirements
	•	macOS Support: The game must run on macOS (latest versions, targeting Apple Silicon Macs primarily). It should feel native on Mac: using Metal graphics API, supporting Retina resolutions, proper Mac keyboard/mouse inputs, etc. Performance on a typical Mac (e.g. a MacBook Pro with an M3 or M2 chip) should be optimized – perhaps targeting 1080p or 1440p at good quality settings for 30-60 FPS. We will leverage Apple’s hardware (which now supports ray tracing in Apple Silicon GPUs via Metal ￼) to ensure features like path tracing run efficiently.
	•	Cross-Platform (Desired): While Mac is primary, ideally the engine is cross-platform. This means abstracting the rendering layer to support DirectX/Vulkan for Windows and potentially Linux’s Vulkan, and ensuring any OS-specific code has alternatives. We won’t use technologies that lock to one platform (e.g. no DirectX 12-specific features without Vulkan equivalents). File paths, networking (if any), etc., will be handled in a cross-platform manner. Our custom engine will be designed to be portable, though testing and performance tuning on Windows/Linux would be a stretch goal beyond the core Mac development.
	•	Hardware Requirements: As a high-end game, RealCraft will likely require a relatively modern GPU (with ray-tracing support for full experience) and a multi-core CPU. However, one objective is scalability: graphics settings can be lowered (e.g. turning off path tracing in favor of simpler lighting, reducing draw distance, etc.) to allow play on lower-end systems or laptops. We recognize not all players will have an RTX 4090 or an M3 Max chip; the product should accommodate a range of hardware by providing quality presets. Memory-wise, infinite worlds are heavy, but we will stream data to keep memory usage bounded. The engine should ideally run with, say, 16GB RAM and a GPU with 6-8GB VRAM at minimum, but this will be refined in technical planning.

6. Non-Functional Requirements
	•	Performance & Optimization: High realism often conflicts with performance, so the game must be heavily optimized. As a requirement, frame rates should remain smooth (target 60 FPS, minimum 30 FPS) during typical gameplay on target hardware. We will use profiling to ensure no single system (rendering, physics, or world streaming) starves the others. Multithreading and parallelism are required: rendering on GPU, physics on a separate thread or using a job system, world gen on background threads, etc. The game should also utilize all CPU cores efficiently and not just max out one core.
	•	Stability & Reliability: The engine must handle the extreme cases (very long play sessions generating thousands of chunks, or complex player constructions) without crashing or glitching. Memory management is critical – avoid leaks and clean up far-away regions properly. We must also handle precision issues gracefully (as the player goes far out, ensure physics and rendering remain stable by origin shifting and using double precision where needed for world coordinates).
	•	Save System: Even though the world is infinite, players need to save and load their progress. We will implement a robust saving mechanism (likely region-based file storage like Minecraft’s Anvil format, or a custom database) that records modified chunks, player inventory, and game state. Saving should not pause the game for long – possibly done incrementally in the background. On load, the player’s immediate surroundings are prioritized to restore so they can start playing quickly, with distant areas streaming in after.
	•	Usability & Accessibility: Despite the complexity under the hood, the user interface and controls should remain straightforward. We will provide intuitive controls (WASD movement, mouse look, simple key for placing/breaking blocks, etc., akin to Minecraft). Any new mechanics (like structural integrity) will have visual feedback (maybe cracks appearing on overloaded structures) to communicate what’s happening. We also consider accessibility options like adjustable UI scaling, colorblind-friendly palettes for resource types, etc., to ensure a broad range of players can enjoy the game.

Out of Scope (for Initial Release)

To keep the project focused, certain features are explicitly out of scope for the first version, though they could be revisited later:
	•	Multiplayer/Networking: The game will be single-player only in its initial incarnation. No online or LAN multiplayer, and no server hosting. This avoids the immense complexity of synchronizing a physics-rich, infinite world across networks.
	•	Modding Support: There will be no official mod API or plugin system at launch. The engine is custom and experimental; adding mod support would add significant complexity. The focus is on delivering the core experience first.
	•	VR/AR Support: While immersive graphics beg for VR, supporting VR (or AR on devices) is not planned initially. The UI and performance targets are for standard PC gaming.
	•	Console/Mobile Ports: The target platforms are desktop (Mac/Windows/Linux). Console or mobile versions would require major adaptations (especially given hardware limits and different APIs), so they are not considered at this stage.
	•	Alternate Game Modes: Aside from Creative and Survival, other modes (Hardcore, Adventure, etc. as known in Minecraft) are not prioritized. Players looking for those experiences can simulate them via self-imposed rules in survival for now.

Conclusion

In summary, RealCraft’s technical design combines proven game development techniques with advanced algorithms from graphics and procedural generation research to realize a “Minecraft but realistic” vision. We cite prior art and research to ensure our approach is grounded: from using GPU-accelerated hydraulic erosion for natural terrain ￼ ￼, to adopting path tracing for unparalleled lighting realism ￼, and leveraging voxel-based physics for destruction and structural simulation ￼. The implementation will be challenging, but by dividing the problem into clear subsystems and utilizing the full power of modern hardware (multi-core CPUs, GPU compute, ray tracing units), we believe we can create a visually stunning, physically believable infinite sandbox. RealCraft aims to set a new standard for sandbox worlds, where the only limit is the player’s imagination – and the laws of physics!
