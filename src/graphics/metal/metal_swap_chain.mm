// RealCraft Graphics Abstraction Layer
// metal_swap_chain.mm - Metal swap chain implementation
// Note: Main implementation is in metal_device.mm for close integration with device

// This file exists for CMake compatibility but the actual MetalSwapChain
// implementation is in metal_device.mm since it's tightly coupled with the device.

// Empty translation unit - implementation in metal_device.mm
